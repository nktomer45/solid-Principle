#Interface segregation principle

Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.
The principle states that many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. Clients should 
not be forced to implement a function they do no need.

#Clients shouldnâ€™t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
